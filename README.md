# Introduction to Databases Checkpoint

## Overview

This repository contains a presentation comparing **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases, with a focus on **MongoDB** as the representative NoSQL database. The goal of this checkpoint is to explore the key differences between SQL and MongoDB, their functionalities, and when to use each type of database.

## Presentation Structure

The presentation consists of **5 slides**, covering the following topics:

### Slide 1: Introduction
- Introduces the two database paradigms: SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational).
- Explains the importance of understanding the differences between these database types.
- Highlights MongoDB as a popular example of a NoSQL database.

### Slide 2: SQL Database Overview
- Defines SQL databases and their characteristics:
  - Relational data model (tables, rows, columns).
  - Predefined schemas.
  - ACID compliance for ensuring data integrity.
  - Support for complex queries, JOINs, and transactions.
- Provides examples of use cases for SQL databases (e.g., financial systems, inventory management).

### Slide 3: MongoDB Overview
- Describes MongoDB as a document-based NoSQL database:
  - Flexible schema (JSON-like documents).
  - Horizontal scalability through sharding.
  - High availability with replica sets.
  - Optimized for performance in read-heavy applications.
- Lists common use cases for MongoDB (e.g., content management, IoT, real-time analytics).

### Slide 4: Comparison of MongoDB vs SQL
- Compares SQL and MongoDB across several dimensions:
  - Data model (relational vs document-based).
  - Schema flexibility (fixed vs flexible).
  - Scalability (vertical vs horizontal).
  - Query language (SQL vs MongoDB Query Language).
  - Transaction support (full ACID vs limited ACID).
- Summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of each database type.

### Slide 5: Conclusion
- Provides guidance on choosing the right database for specific needs:
  - Use SQL for structured data and mission-critical applications.
  - Use MongoDB for unstructured or semi-structured data and scenarios requiring high scalability.
- Offers recommendations based on use cases.
